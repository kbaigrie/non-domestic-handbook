                        the European Harmonised fire tests. BS EN 13501-1: 2018 provides the
                        reaction to fire classification procedure for all construction products
                        within the scope of the Construction Products Regulations. </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e12164"></a>2.E.1 Reaction to fire classification</h3></div></div></div><p>For all construction products, the consideration is of a fire, initiated
                        in a room, which can grow and eventually reach flashover. This scenario
                        includes three fire situations corresponding to three stages in the
                        development of a fire:</p><p>
                        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>the first stage includes initiation of the fire by ignition of
                                    a product, with a small flame, on a limited area of a
                                    product,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the second stage addresses fire growth eventually reaching
                                    flashover. It is simulated by a single burning item in a corner
                                    of the room, creating a heat flux on adjacent surfaces. For
                                    floorings, fire is seen to grow in the room of origin, creating
                                    a heat flux on the floorings in an adjacent room or corridor,
                                    through a door opening, and</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>in the post-flashover phase all combustible products
                                    contribute to the fire load.</p></li></ul></div><p>
                    </p><p>Currently, there is no recognised European Harmonised fire test for
                        facades or construction products exposed to a fire in a cavity. It has
                        therefore been necessary to use the reaction to fire classification system
                        in BS EN 13501-1: 2018 for external wall cladding systems in certain
                        circumstances.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Transitional period</strong></span> - British and
                        European fire tests will co-exist in use until the British Standard
                        classifications are withdrawn.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e12178"></a>2.E.2 Harmonised European Standards</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Non-combustibility test (EN ISO 1182)</strong></span>
                        identifies products that will not, or not significantly, contribute to a
                        fire, regardless of their end use. The assumption is that products
                        classified as A1 make no contribution to fire growth or to the fully
                        developed fire. A product classified as A1 is assumed to present no smoke
                        hazard.</p><p>The European Commission has drawn up a list of products which, under
                        specified conditions, can be considered to be class A1 without testing. This
                        information is given in the Commission Decision 96/603/EC (OJ L 267

                        determines the potential maximum total heat release of a product when
                        completely burning, regardless of its end use.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Single burning item test (EN 13823)</strong></span>
                        evaluates the potential contribution of a product to the development of a

                        corner near to that product. When a classification includes &#8220;s3, d2&#8221; this
                        means that there is no limit set for smoke production and/or flaming
                        droplets/particles.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Ignitability test (EN ISO 11925-2)</strong></span>
