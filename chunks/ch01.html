                    </p><p>This document gives guidance on how to comply with these
                        regulations.</p><p>This is one of two Technical Handbooks, one covering <a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic
                            buildings</a> and the other non-<a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic buildings</a>. These Technical
                        Handbooks have been issued by Scottish Ministers for the purpose of
                        providing practical guidance with respect to the requirements of the
                        provisions of the building regulations under a notice given in accordance
                        with Section 4(2) of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. Each Handbook has
                        eight sections. Section 0, this section, is identical in both Handbooks. It
                        covers general issues and sets out how and when the regulations apply to
                            <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> and
                            <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">works</a>.</p><p>The 2013 Edition of the Handbooks are being published electronically and
                        are available free on the Scottish Government, Building Standards Division
                        website. </p><p>Sections 1 to 7 give guidance on how to achieve the standards set by the
                        regulations, and there are different sets for <a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic
                            buildings</a> and non-<a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic buildings</a>. The seven sections
                        each cover a number of related standards. They are:</p><p>Section 1 Structure</p><p>Section 2 Fire</p><p>Section 3 Environment</p><p>Section 4 Safety</p><p>Section 5 Noise</p><p>Section 6 Energy</p><p>Section 7 Sustainability</p><p>Each of the seven sections consists of an introduction and then general
                        guidance on the standards within the section. This is followed by each
                        standard which has specific introductory information and guidance on how to
                        comply with the standard. At the end of the Handbook, after Section 7, there
                        are the following two sections:</p><p>Appendix A: Defined terms.</p><p>Appendix B: List of standards and other publications.</p><p>The Technical Handbooks are supported by a Procedural Handbook, published
                        separately, which clarifies the intent of the Building (Scotland) Procedures
                        Regulations 2004. A separate procedural guidance document for Crown <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> has also
                        been produced.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e54"></a>0.1.2 The Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004</h3></div></div></div><p>This Technical Handbook gives guidance on achieving the standards set in
                        the Building (Scotland) Regulations. The standards themselves can be found
                        in schedule 5 to regulation 9, and are in the form of &#8216;expanded functional
                        standards&#8217;. That is, the standards describe the functions a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> should
                        perform, such as &#8216;providing resistance to the spread of fire&#8217;.</p><p>The Building (Scotland) Regulations made by the Scottish Ministers are
                        subject to approval by the Scottish Parliament. The content of the
                        regulations, so far as it relates to technical specifications, is also
                        scrutinised by the European Commission (EC). The EC checks with all the
                        other countries that have adopted the <a class="link" href="apa.html#construction_products_directive">Construction Products Regulations</a> (CPR) to ensure that no
                        barriers to trade in <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a> products are created, either directly or indirectly
                        by the way products are described.</p><p>To meet the requirements of the CPR, materials and <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a> methods
                        must be described by use of suitable European Standards wherever these
                        exist. As there is a rolling programme of change to these National and
                        European Standards, which includes conversion to, and the further provision
                        of, ENs and harmonised ENs, the Handbooks have been designed to be readily
                        updated. An explanation of the relevance and status of specific European and
                        British standards referred to in the Handbooks is in the section concerned.
                        There is also a list of the publications referred to in the Handbooks
                        provided in Appendix B.</p><p>The arrangement of Sections 1 - 7 within the Handbooks relates directly to
                        the Basic Works Requirements of the CPR (as published by the EC), which
                            <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a>
                        <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">works</a> are expected to
                        satisfy when they have been properly designed and <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">built</a>.  The arrangement is as
                        follows:</p><p>Section 1 Structure (EC - Mechanical resistance and stability)</p><p>Section 2 Fire (EC - Safety in case of fire)</p><p>Section 3 Environment (EC - Hygiene, health and the environment)</p><p>Section 4 Safety (EC - Safety and accessibility in use)</p><p>Section 5 Noise (EC - Protection against noise)</p><p>Section 6 Energy (EC - Energy, economy and heat retention)</p><p>Section 7 Sustainability (EC - Sustainable use of natural resources)</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e74"></a>0.1.3 The building standards system</h3></div></div></div><p>The building regulations are enforced through the building standards
                        system that is established by the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. The Act sets
                        out the enabling powers that allow the Scottish Ministers to make, not only
                        the building regulations, but also procedural regulations, fees regulations
                        and the other supporting legislation needed to operate the system. The
                        system is designed to ensure that new <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> and <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">works</a> achieve the objectives of <a class="link" href="apa.html#the_act">the Act</a> in terms of
                        health, safety, welfare, convenience, conservation of fuel and power, and
                        sustainable development.</p><p>The roles of those operating the building standards system are explained
                        in detail in the guidance on the procedural regulations. Briefly, the duty
                        to comply with the building regulations lies with the owner, or in some
                        cases the client, for the <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a>. Before <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> begins a building warrant must be obtained.</p><p>For some simpler <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">works</a>
                        a warrant is not required (see regulation 5 and schedule 3), but the
                        regulations still apply. The owner or client again has the duty to comply.
                        The role of issuing warrants and accepting completion certificates rests
                        with verifiers, enforcement is by local authorities, and the system is
                        overseen and updated by the Building Standards Division (BSD).  BSD forms
                        part of the Scottish Government and acts on behalf of, and is responsible
                        to, Scottish Ministers. These bodies are further explained in the guidance
                        to the procedural regulations.</p><p>The building standards system is pre-emptive, ensuring so far as possible
                        that the proposed <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">works</a>
                        will comply with the regulations. It recognises that proposals can change
                        during <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a>, so there are requirements for amendments to the
                        proposals to be agreed and recorded. On completion, the owner or client must
                        certify that the <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">works</a>
                        have been <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">constructed</a> in accordance with the building warrant and the
                        building regulations. The verifier will make reasonable inquiry to ensure
                        the completion certificate is accurate before accepting the certificate.
                        Usually an inspection of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">works</a> will be made, and on most projects some inspection of
                            <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> in progress
                        will also have been carried out. However verifiers cannot inspect all
                        materials and <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> on
                        every <a class="link" href="apa.html#building_site">building

                        the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> owner.
                        This Technical Handbook has been issued by Scottish Ministers, through the
                        Building Standards Division, for the purpose of providing practical guidance
                        with respect to the building regulations. If the guidance is followed in
                        full then this should be accepted by the verifier as indicating that the
                        building regulations have been complied with. However it is quite acceptable
                        to use alternative methods of compliance provided they fully satisfy the
                        regulations.</p><p>Failure to comply with the Technical Handbook does not render a person
                        liable to civil or criminal procedures, but proof of compliance with the
                        guidance may be relied on in any proceedings as tending to negative
                        liability for an alleged contravention of the building regulations.</p><p>Following the advice in the Technical Handbooks is therefore likely to be
                        the normal way of complying with the building regulations. However, a
                        designer may put forward other ways of meeting the regulations, in the form
                        of alternative solutions.</p><p>There are a further three guidance documents that have the same standing
                        as the Technical Handbooks. Scottish Ministers have issued these under
                        Section 4(1) of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. They are:</p><p>

                    </p><p>In due course other documents may be issued by Scottish Ministers to
                        provide further guidance. Such guidance might deal with specific <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> types, or
                        provide alternative methods of showing compliance with those provided in the
                        Technical Handbooks.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e110"></a>0.1.5 Alternative solutions</h3></div></div></div><p>The use of expanded functional standards, backed up by detailed guidance,
                        provides a flexible system of control. Consideration of alternative
                        solutions is assisted by the expansion of the functional standards
                        previously used in the building standards regulations to clarify the
                        necessary properties of each <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>. The need for a formal
                        relaxation of standards is reduced as meeting the full details of given
                        solutions is no longer mandatory. The professional judgement of the
                        verifier, assisted by guidance on questions referred to Scottish Ministers,
                        through the Building Standards Division, decides whether a standard is
                        met.</p><p>In considering alternative solutions, however it is necessary to have
                        regard to the details of this guidance. Where performance standards or
                        policy statements are given, every part of the solution is expected to meet
                        them. As a result, alternative solutions that appear suitable may not be
                        acceptable in detail. For example, some of the solutions offered in relation
                        to the English and Welsh building regulations, in the &#8216;Approved Documents&#8217;
                        (ADs), are not suitable because the levels of thermal insulation recommended
                        are not the same. Similarly different approaches are taken to the control of
                        fire size and the design of <a class="link" href="apa.html#compartment">compartmentation</a> which means that <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">constructions</a> meeting
                        the AD on fire safety may not be acceptable. This will vary in time as both
                        ADs and the Scottish Technical Handbooks are updated. Solutions based on
                        other documents, such as British or European Standards, will have to be
                        carefully evaluated to see if the Scottish standards are being met in an
                        appropriate manner.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e117"></a>0.1.6 Domestic and non-domestic buildings</h3></div></div></div><p>Where any <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> contains both domestic uses and non-domestic uses, the
                        appropriate parts from each Technical Handbook will need to be used to
                        ensure the standards are complied with in full, for example a caretakers

                        <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>. However,

                        areas in a block of <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwellings</a> that are exclusively associated with the <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwellings</a> should be
                        considered using the domestic guidance. Examples of this might be a <a class="link" href="apa.html#room">room</a> used as an <a class="link" href="apa.html#office">office</a> for the operation
                        of a <a class="link" href="apa.html#sheltered_housing_complex">sheltered housing complex</a> or a lounge communal to a block of
                            <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwellings</a>. It is
                        also a general principle that where a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> or part of a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> might be
                        seen as falling into more than one category it should be designed to meet
                        the most stringent recommendations.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e133"></a>0.1.7 Latest changes</h3></div></div></div><p>The following is a summary of the changes which have been introduced since

                        It is not expected that the standards will change regularly as these are set
                        in the building regulations and can only be changed with Parliamentary
                        approval. Therefore it is anticipated that the guidance will be replaced
                        more regularly than the standards themselves.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e157"></a>0.1.9 Arrangement of Section 0</h3></div></div></div><p>Section 0 is arranged to follow the actual regulations. This sub-section
                        provides an introduction to the building standards system. Sub-section 0.2
                        covers regulations 1 and 2 which are the citation, commencement and
                        interpretation. Sub-sections 0.3 to 0.15 cover the significant technical
                        regulations with each sub-section setting out and discussing the regulation
                        with the same number (sub-section 0.3 covering regulation 3 etc.).
                        Regulation 16 establishes which regulations cannot ever be relaxed by
                        Scottish Ministers. These are the regulations on citation and commencement,
                        interpretation, exempted buildings, <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> not requiring a warrant and the
                        methods of measurement. Regulation 17 was introduced in 2007 to help with
                        the implementation of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e161"></a>0.1.10 Certification</h3></div></div></div><p>Scottish Ministers can, under Section 7 of the Building (Scotland) Act
                        2003, approve schemes for the certification of design or <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a> for
                        compliance with the mandatory functional standards. Such schemes are
                        approved on the basis that the procedures adopted by the scheme will take
                        account of the need to co-ordinate the <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> of various designers and specialist
                        contractors. Individuals approved to provide certification services under
