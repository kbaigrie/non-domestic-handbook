safety is the paramount objective of fire safety. Non-domestic <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> should be
                        designed and <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">constructed</a> in such a way that the risk of fire is reduced and
                        if a fire does occur, there are measures in place to restrict the growth of
                        fire and smoke to enable the occupants to escape safely and fire-fighters to
                        deal with fire safely and effectively.</p><p>There are more than 2000 reported fires in non-<a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic
                            buildings</a> every year in Scotland. The most common cause of
                        accidental fires in non-<a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic buildings</a> is faulty appliances,
                        accounting for more than 20% of fires followed by cooking at around 16%.
                        Statistics also show that around 24% of fires in non-<a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic
                            buildings</a> are deliberately started. While the number of deaths
                        from fires in non-<a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic buildings</a> is less than <a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic
                            buildings</a> the potential for significant life loss and injuries is
                        far greater. This is due to large occupancy capacities, building complexity,
                        occupant capability and behaviour including the potential for delay in
                        occupant evacuation following the outbreak of fire.</p><p>In the event of an outbreak of fire, it is important that the occupants
                        are warned as soon as possible. The guidance to Standard 2.11 provides
                        recommendations for the installation of alarm and detection systems in <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> where
                        people may be asleep or where there is a particularly high risk.</p><p>The standards and guidance in this section are designed to work together
                        to provide a balanced approach to fire safety. The <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> elements, materials, components
                        or other parts of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> identified in the guidance should follow the
                        appropriate performance levels that are recommended throughout the guidance.
                        However where an element, material, component, or other part of a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> is covered
                        by more than one standard, the more demanding guidance should be followed in
                        most cases.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3185"></a>2.0.2 Aims</h3></div></div></div><p>The purpose of the guidance in Section 2 is to achieve the following
                        objectives in the case of an outbreak of fire within the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>to protect life</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>to assist the fire and rescue services, and</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>to further the achievement of sustainable development.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Protection of life</strong></span> - it is important
                        to recognise that the standards will not guarantee the life safety of all
                            <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>
                        occupants. Occupants in <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> do not normally perceive themselves to be at risk from
                        fire and are not usually aware of the speed that fire can spread. The risk
                        to occupants is greater if they are asleep during the outbreak of fire as
                        they are likely to be roused more slowly. Occupants should be warned as soon
                        as possible following the outbreak of fire and the guidance to Standard 2.11
                        provides recommendations for the installation of alarm and detection systems
                        in non-<a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic
                            buildings</a>.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Fire and rescue service</strong></span> - in some
                        cases, occupants will not react quickly enough before being overcome by the
                        effects of the fire and smoke and as a result, may require to be rescued by
                        the fire and rescue service. For facilities to assist the fire and rescue
                        service, see Standards 2.12 to 2.14.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Sustainability</strong></span> - the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> regulations
                        are primarily concerned with the protection of people from the dangers
                        inherent in <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>, rather than protecting the owners of <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> from any
                        economic loss which might occur. However following the guidance in the
                        handbook will continue to embed active and passive fire protection systems
                        within <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>
                        which should reduce the likelyhood of the total destruction of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> following

                        appropriate for the guidance in Section 2 Fire. For example, to establish
                        the height of the topmost storey for fire and rescue service facilities, the
                        height should be measured from the fire and rescue service access level and
                        not necessarily the lowest ground level. Therefore, methods of measurement
                        unique to fire are described within the guidance under each of the relevant
                        standards.</p><p>The following guidance on measurements are unique to Section 2 Fire of the
                        Handbooks and where appropriate, should be read in conjunction with the
                        measurements specified in schedule 4 to regulation 7 as set out in Section 0

                        Handbook indicates one or sometimes more than one means of complying with
                        the mandatory building standards 2.1 to 2.15. In the majority of projects it
                        is envisaged that meeting the guidance will be the usual means of showing
                        that compliance with the building standards has been achieved. </p><p>However, it should be appreciated that, due to the generic nature of the
                        guidance it cannot cover all building designs or, for example, innovative or
                        new methods of construction. In such cases the designer or engineer will be
                        required to show, by alternative means, that compliance with the building
                        standards will be achieved in the completed <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>. For example, where the elements
                        of structure are engineered timber (including cross laminated timber), the
                        structure should maintain stability during the fire growth and fully
                        developed post flashover phases of the fire without reliance on intervention
                        from the fire and rescue services. Encapsulation of combustible elements of
                        structure may require to be provided to protect the structure against
                        ignition and charring for the duration of the fire. Where encapsulation
                        (i.e. both physically and in terms of the period of fire resistance
                        duration) is not provided or does not protect the combustible material
                        against ignition and charring for the duration of the fire, the structural
                        fire engineer should consider the additional contribution of the exposed
                        combustible material to the fire load density including an assessment of the
                        structural stability of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> due to both potential
                        delamination and failure of the fixings at elevated temperatures.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Fire safety engineering</strong></span> - it is
                        reasonable to demonstrate compliance with the functional standards by
                        alternative means and in such cases, the fire engineer, the building
                        standards verifier and the fire and rescue service should be consulted early
                        in the design process.</p><p>Fire safety engineering may be the only practical way to achieve a
                        satisfactory level of fire safety in some large and complex <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> or where
                        innovative or new methods of construction are used. In such cases a holistic
                        approach is desirable from first principles rather than following, in part
                        or wholly, the guidance contained in the Technical Handbooks. In such cases
                        the building standards verifier and the fire and rescue service should be
                        consulted as part of the Qualitative Design Review (QDR) process.</p><p>For many projects it is likely that designers will follow the guidance in
                        the Technical Handbooks and fire engineering techniques will not be
                        necessary. In its simplest form the QDR team may define the acceptance
                        criteria in terms of compliance with the Handbooks.</p><p>However, it is common for fire engineers and regulators to be engaged
                        relatively late in the design process to resolve fire safety issues raised
                        during the verification or, in extreme cases, the construction process. This
                        is unhelpful as fire engineers are often commissioned to resolve specific
                        issues where the design does not follow the guidance rather than assessing
                        the building holistically. This can lead to a comparative exercise against
                        unrealistic worse case scenarios of a &#8220;code compliant&#8221; design to justify
                        deviations. This is not the intent of the guidance and it is important that
                        the safety goals are well defined and achieved with a sufficient margin of
                        safety. The objective of a comparative study should be to demonstrate that
                        the building design, as a whole, presents no greater risk to the occupants
                        than a similar type of building designed in accordance with the Technical
                        Handbook guidance. Further, it is common for the inappropriate use of
                        Computational Fluid Dynamics where the deviations from the Handbooks would
                        not merit such an exercise to be carried out. It is recognised that there
                        may be instances where small deviations from the guidance do not warrant a
                        &#8220;whole building&#8221; fire engineered design and inevitably involves a degree of
                        negotiation without the need for detailed analysis.</p><p>Not all cases of variance from the guidance will require the
                        appointment of a fire engineer. Reference could be made to &#8216;A simplified
                        approach to alternative fire safety strategies&#8217; Scottish Government (2010),

                        appropriate to vary the guidance contained in this Handbook when assessing

                        listed in terms of their architectural or historic interest. In such cases,
                        it would be appropriate to take into account a range of fire safety
                        features, some of which are dealt with in this Handbook and some of which
                        are not addressed in any detail. For more detailed information, guidance is

                        complex and many require extensive use of engineering judgement. The
                        following documents are cited to ensure that the guidance given encompasses
                        best practice worldwide:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>BS 7974: 2019 Application of fire safety engineering

                        fire engineering approach have sufficient technical training, knowledge and
                        experience to understand fully the risks involved.</p><p>The objectives of any fire safety strategy should be established first
                            and designers and verifiers should be aware of the importance of the
                            design assumptions. For example, the strategy should include an
                            assessment of the system reliability. This will help to ensure that the
                            fire safety objectives have been met.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Responsible person</strong></span> - it is important that
                        owners/responsible person understand that the fire safety measures installed
                        in a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> need
                        to be maintained and tested over the life time of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> so that they
                        will operate effectively. BS 7974 and IFEG assume that all aspects of the
                        fire engineering strategy are capable of being maintained and deployed over
                        the lifetime of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>. If for example, alterations are found to be necessary
                        due to changes to the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> layout, the original strategy may need to be
                        re-evaluated to ensure the fire safety provisions have not been compromised.
                        For this reason, the fire strategy should preferably support any fire safety
                        risk assessment required under Part 3 of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005, as
                        amended.</p><p>Fire safety engineering involves the use of scientific based calculations
                        and/or statistical information to demonstrate an adequate level of safety
                        for a specific <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>, structure or installation. In this regard the fire
                        safety strategy is based on performance rather than prescription. Therefore,
                        fire safety engineering is about the need to identify the fire hazard,
                        assess the fire risks, understand the consequences and to offer fire safety
                        strategies and designs to show how the objectives have been met. The &#8216;tools&#8217;
                        that support fire engineering can include calculation methods, which are
                        used to demonstrate that under a worst reasonable case, tenable conditions
                        are maintained during the evacuation period. For example, a smoke exhaust
                        fan in a smoke reservoir within an atrium space fails to operate but the
                        smoke layer height continues to be maintained by the activation of a
                        stand-by fan.</p><p>It is recognised that fire engineering is still a rapidly developing field
                        and as such does not have the standardised codes for approaching and solving
                        problems compared to other engineering disciplines. The documents identified

                        under Section 7 of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003, approve schemes for the
                        certification of design or <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a> for compliance with the mandatory functional
                        standards. Such schemes are approved on the basis that the procedures
                        adopted by the scheme will take account of the need to co-ordinate the work
                        of various designers and specialist contractors. Individuals approved to
                        provide certification services under the scheme are assessed to ensure that
                        they have the qualifications, skills and experience required to certify
                        compliance for the work covered by the scope of the scheme. Checking
                        procedures adopted by Approved Certifiers will deliver design or
                        installation reliability in accordance with legislation.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Third party accreditation</strong></span> - Since the

                        satisfactory site installation, testing and maintenance, independent schemes
                        of certification and accreditation of installers and maintenance firms of
                        such will provide confidence in the appropriate standard of workmanship

                        and an accreditation of installers scheme. Third party accredited product
                        conformity certification schemes not only provide a means of identifying
                        materials and designs of systems, products or structures which have
                        demonstrated that they have the requisite performance in fire, but
                        additionally provide confidence that the systems, materials, products or
                        structures actually supplied are provided to the same specification or
                        design as that tested/assessed.</p><p>Third party accreditation of installers of systems, materials, products or
                        structures provides a means of ensuring that installations have been
                        conducted by knowledgeable contractors to appropriate standards, thereby
                        increasing the reliability of the anticipated performance in fire.</p><p>Local authority verifiers may accept the certification of products,
                        components, materials or structures under such schemes as evidence of
                        compliance with the relevant standard. Similarly, local authority verifiers
